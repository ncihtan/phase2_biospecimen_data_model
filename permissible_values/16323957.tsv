PERMITTED_VALUE	LONG_NAME	DEFINITION
Desiccant	Desiccant	A material that absorbs moisture from its surrounding environment.
EDTA	Edetic Acid	The acid form of edetate, a chelating agent with anti-hypercalcemic and anticoagulant properties. Edetic acid binds calcium and heavy metal ions, forming soluble stable complexes which are readily excreted by the kidneys. This results in a decrease in serum calcium levels. This agent is also used as an anticoagulant for blood specimens and is applied as a treatment of lead poisoning.
FFPE	Formalin-Fixed Paraffin-Embedded	Refers to samples that have been preserved with formalin and then embedded into a paraffin block for sectioning.
Formalin Fixed - Buffered	Buffered Formalin Fixation	The use of buffered formalin for preservation of tissue samples.
Formalin Fixed - Unbuffered	Unbuffered Formalin Fixation	The use of unbuffered formalin for preservation of tissue samples.
Formalin Fixed Tissue	Formalin-Fixed Tissue	A tissue sample that has been fixed with formalin.
Glutaraldehyde	Glutaraldehyde	A water-soluble oily liquid, C5H8O2, containing two aldehyde groups, used as a disinfectant and as a fixative for biological tissues.
Isopentane	Isopentane	An organic, branched-chain alkane with five carbon atoms.
Liquid Nitrogen	Liquid Nitrogen	Nitrogen in a liquid state, having been super-cooled to about -200 degrees Celsius.
Liquid Nitrogen Vapor	Liquid Nitrogen Vapor	The gaseous state of liquid nitrogen with a temperature of -167 degrees Celsius.
Not Applicable	Not applicable	Determination of a value is not relevant in the current context.
Not Reported	Not Reported	Not provided or available.
OCT	Optimal Cutting Temperature Compound	A solution of water soluble glycols and resins that provide a specimen support matrix for cryostat sectioning at temperatures of -10 degrees C and below.
Paraffin Block	Paraffin Embedded Tissue	Tissue that is preserved and embedded in paraffin.
RNALater	RNALater	Trade name for an aqueous, non-toxic tissue storage reagent that rapidly permeates tissues to stabilize and protect cellular RNA.
TRIzol	Phenol and Guanidine Isothiocyanate Solution	A ready-to-use reagent for the isolation of high-quality total RNA or the simultaneous isolation of RNA, DNA, and protein from biological samples. It is a monophasic solution of phenol and guanidine isothiocyanate.
Unknown	Unknown	Not known, observed, recorded; or reported as unknown by the data contributor.
