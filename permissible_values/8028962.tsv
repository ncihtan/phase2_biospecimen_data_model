PERMITTED_VALUE	LONG_NAME	DEFINITION
Cryopreserved	Cryopreservation	Preservation of cells, tissues, organs, or embryos by storage at low temperatures.
Cytospin Slide	Cytospin Slide	A microscope slide prepared by depositing cells directly onto a slide by centrifugation. The cytocentrifuge spins at an angle, at low speeds, allowing the cells to adhere to the slide in a monolayer format.
Fixation	Fixation	The chemical preservation of a substance to maintain structural and/or molecular features of that substance as they exist in the living entity.
Fresh	Fresh Specimen	Tissue which has not been exposed to a fixative solution.
Fresh Dissociated	Fresh Dissociated Tissue Preparation	A tissue preparation process that takes fresh tissue and dissociates it into single cell suspensions.
Fresh Dissociated and Single Cell Sorted	Fresh Dissociated Tissue Preparation, Single Cell Sorted	A tissue preparation process that separates fresh dissociated tissue cells into cell populations by single cell sorting.
Fresh Dissociated and Single Cell Sorted into Plates	Fresh Dissociated Tissue Preparation, Single Cell Sorted into Plates	A tissue preparation process that takes dissociated, sorted cells and distributes them into cell propagation plates.
Frozen	Frozen Specimen	A specimen that has been subjected to and immobilized by severe cold.
Not Applicable	Not applicable	Determination of a value is not relevant in the current context.
Not Reported	Not Reported	Not provided or available.
Refrigerated	Refrigerated	A specimen that has been kept or preserved at a low temperature in a refrigerator.
Refrigerated Vacuum Chamber	Refrigerated Vacuum Chamber	A device designed to maintain a vacuum at a below-ambient temperature.
Snap Frozen	Quick Freeze	To freeze rapidly so as to preserve structure and prevent ice crystal formation.
Unknown	Unknown	Not known, not observed, not recorded, or refused.
